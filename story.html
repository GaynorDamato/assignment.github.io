            <h2> Miro</h2>
            <p>
                Miro held his empty glass between his frail hands as he observed
                young families passing by. His white hair drifted slowly in the wind as
                his head faced the pavement and his big square glasses barely held
                on his nose. Sitting on his favourite blue stool in front of his house,
                with his elbows resting on his knees, his thoughts drifted. Miro was
                amused by the rainbow after the rain that, for him, never seemed to
                shine when he stepped out his door, and by his only companion, Ben.
                The white and grey cat was like a son to him. Miro spent hours talking
                to his cat which he rescued from his own street. Overall, his dream
                was to be welcomed with warmth and joy by his own family that never
                visited him, and to wake up every day to an everlasting bright rainbow
                which he was mesmerised by. Unfortunately, his time on this earth
                was limited and he knew that his wishes would never be met. One
                Sunday morning, the usual families were passing by his house and
                the children were pointing to the brightest rainbow they have ever
                seen in the longest time. What they didnâ€™t notice was the absence of
                the lonely man who sat right where they stood. The morning seemed
                peaceful and unlike the previously dull days, the morning was very
                bright and the sun radiated for what seems forever.
